# ABOUT THIS PROJECT:

StayFit is a web application that helps users start and track their fitness journey. StayFit comes with a BMI calculator, a mini-exercise wiki, and an intuitive workout planner. StayFit also has a register feature, in which users who want to save or access their info may sign up or log in to the website.

# HOW IT WAS BUILT:

The front-end was developed using React, primarily in jsx, html and css. The back-end uses a MySQL database, javascript in a node.js runtime environment, the node.js framework express.js. The project also uses a JSON file storing the necessary exercise information.
